/**
 * Portfolio project data – single source of truth.
 *
 * This file lives inside the SafariCharge dashboard project so Next.js
 * (Turbopack) can resolve it at `@/data/portfolioProjects`.
 *
 * The portfolio (software/portfolio) imports from this same file via a
 * relative path so both apps always show the same set of projects.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HOW TO ADD A NEW PROJECT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Add a new entry to the `portfolioProjects` array below.
 * 2. Choose an `iconName` from https://lucide.dev/icons/ (e.g. "Rocket").
 * 3. The new project will automatically appear in both:
 *    - the portfolio (software/portfolio) Projects section, and
 *    - the SafariCharge dashboard Portfolio Projects panel.
